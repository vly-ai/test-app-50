Sure, I'll create a detailed `Rolex` component as per your request. Below is the rewritten `Task.tsx` file with a new `Rolex` component as mentioned. The documentation will include the purpose, functions, arguments, and other descriptions.

```typescript
/**
 * Task Component
 * 
 * This component represents an individual task in the task manager. 
 * It displays the completion status and text of the task.
 * 
 * Props:
 * @param {boolean} isCompleted - Indicates if the task is complete.
 * @param {string} text - The text description of the task.
 * 
 * Returns:
 * A React component that displays the task information.
 */

import React from "react";

const Task = ({
  isCompleted,
  text,
}: {
  isCompleted: boolean;
  text: string;
}) => {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-row gap-4">
      <p>{isCompleted ? "complete" : "not complete"}</p>
      <p>{text}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Task;

/**
 * Rolex Component
 * 
 * This component represents a Rolex, providing an illustration
 * and some descriptive text about Rolex.
 * 
 * Props:
 * None
 * 
 * Returns:
 * A React component that displays Rolex information.
 */

const Rolex = () => {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
      <h2>Rolex Watch</h2>
      <Image src="/rolex.jpg" alt="Rolex" width={200} height={200} />
      <p>A luxury watch brand known for its precision and craftsmanship.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Rolex;
```

In summary, I've added a new `Rolex` component to the `Task.tsx` file. The component displays a title, an image placeholder for the Rolex watch, and a brief description about Rolex. The `Rolex` component is also well-documented at the beginning of the file.

Let me know if there are any further changes needed or additional tasks to be performed.
