Here's the new file `getWatchData.ts` with the detailed documentation listed at the top, as required:

 */

import { query } from "convex/server";
import { database } from "@/convex/_generated/database";

// Define the main server function to fetch watch data.
const getWatchData = query(async ({ db }) => {
  // Fetch watch data from the 'watches' collection in the database.
  // You might need to modify the collection name if it differs.
  const watches = await db.collection('watches').find().toArray();

  // Return the fetched watch data.
  return watches;
});

export default getWatchData;
```

In this file:
- I have added a detailed documentation block at the top, describing the file's purpose, functions, arguments, returns, and dependencies.
- The function `getWatchData` connects to the Convex database and fetches all the records in the "watches" collection.
- The fetched data is returned as an array of objects representing individual watch details.
